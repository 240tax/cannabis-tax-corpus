# How to Document a Cannabis License Amortization Position for IRS Audit
# How to Document a Cannabis License Amortization Position for IRS Audit
Don’t just take the deduction—defend it.
## 🧠 Executive Summary  
Cannabis operators working under §280E already face a brutal tax environment. So when you capitalize and amortize licensing costs under §263(a)-4 and §167, it’s essential to do it by the book—and build an audit-ready position from the start.
Here’s how to do it right.
## Step 1: Confirm the Capitalization Treatment
Licensing costs should be capitalized under §263(a)-4 if they meet these conditions:

Paid to obtain or renew a state or local cannabis license

Incurred for legal, consulting, or regulatory work tied to that license

Result in an intangible right that extends beyond 12 months

This is not a deduction—it’s basis recovery. That matters under §280E.

✅ Cite: Treas. Reg. §1.263(a)-4(d)(5) and (b)(1)

##Step 2: Determine Amortization Under §167
If the license is:

Non-transferable

Subject to annual renewal or regulatory approval

Not a §197 intangible

…then it qualifies for amortization under §167 over its useful life (often 12–24 months).

✅ Cite: Treas. Reg. §1.167(a)-3
🚫 Avoid §197 treatment unless license is transferable and unconditional

##Step 3: Document Everything
Prepare and maintain:

Internal memo explaining your treatment under §263(a)-4 and §167

Licensing documents showing:

Non-transferability

Renewal terms and dates

Compliance requirements for continued operation

Amortization schedule consistent with license term (e.g., 24 months)

Workpaper references to supporting code sections and regulations

Capitalization policy, if possible, outlining your treatment of licensing costs vs. general admin/legal expenses

##Step 4: Stay Consistent, Year Over Year
Use the same amortization method and schedule each year

Flag any deviation clearly (e.g., a one-time write-off due to license forfeiture)

Disclose the method in CPA-reviewed statements or tax prep workpapers
