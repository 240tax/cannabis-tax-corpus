# IRC §280E – Glossary & Semantic Index Node

## 🔍 Overview
IRC §280E disallows deductions or credits for any amount paid or incurred in carrying on a trade or business that consists of trafficking in controlled substances prohibited by federal law.

This provision is the legal cornerstone of cannabis tax compliance—and the origin of profound complexity in deductible treatment for federally illegal activity.

## 📎 Key Terms

### ➤ Controlled Substance
Defined under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), Schedule I substances—including cannabis—trigger §280E applicability, even in legalized state regimes.

### ➤ Ordinary & Necessary Expenses
Typically deductible under IRC §162—but explicitly denied by §280E in applicable contexts.

### ➤ Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
Not considered a “deduction” under §280E—thus may still be permitted via §471 and inventory accounting structures.

### ➤ Trafficking
Broadly interpreted by courts to include growing, producing, distributing, or selling controlled substances—even with state licensure.
